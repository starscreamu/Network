NAT’s useful, but can also cause us problems. For example, if an application embeds an IP address in the payload of a packet, it won’t be changed by NAT. Only the IP in the IP header will. This may cause the application to behave badly.

IPSec is one of these applications. It will see this as packet tampering (a security threat) and drop the packet. NAT Traversal (NAT-T) is a way to work around this.

NAT-T encapsulates the traffic in another layer of UDP. This way, NAT will change the outside layer, and not the inside headers. When the packet arrives, the NAT-T headers are removed, leaving the original header, with the IP addresses intact.
