#One of the ways to implement DAI is via DHCP Snooping

#ARP spoof won't work

#Also there is a limit for ARP massages on an interface per second (15)

ip arp inspection limit rate 100
ip arp inspection interfaces

#Verify that DHCP Snooping is working

ip dhcp snooping binding

ip arp inspection vlan 30
int g0/0
ip arp inspection trust #to Router
show ip arp inspection vlan 30
ip arp inspection statistics


#For none DHCP clients we create a static entry

arp access-list OUR-LIST
permit ip host 10.0.0.2(the host which has static ip) mac host 0015.15dd.1234
ip arp inspection filter OUR-LIST

#Additional validation check which is nott enabled by default

ip arp inpection validate dst-mac ip src-mac
